## Introduction

This is a Microsoft Teams clone built with React JS and [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io)!

React JS is the programming language of choice, and Chat Engine is a set of APIs and UI Kit specific to chat.

It's a good example of learning react and creating something production ready! It took barely 48hrs to build this stunning interface. Big special thanks to JSMastery for all pro tips and sample materials.
